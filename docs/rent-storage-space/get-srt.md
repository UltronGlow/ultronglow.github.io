# Get SRT to Rent Storage
---

Renting storage space on the [**UltronGlow Storage Market**](https://www.ultronscan.io/market/) is done by obtaining
SRT (Storage Resource Token).  SRT is a credit which is used exclusively for renting storage, and is designed such
that once you exchange UTG for SRT, the price of SRT remains constant.  This avoids the problem of the potentially
fluctuating price of UTG during a rental agreement.

For example, if you convert the equivalent of $10 of UTG into SRT, that SRT is guaranteed to be worth $10 of services
on the Storage Market.  As you enter a rental agreement, you can rest assured that the actual price of your rental
will not fluctuate as the the price of UTG changes over time.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to convert a portion of your UTG over to SRT to start renting storage.

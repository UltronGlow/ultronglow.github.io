# Delegate
---

Once you have completed the [**prerequisites**](get-started-delegate-staking.md)

## Steps

### 1 - Delegate your pledge

1. Navigate to the [**Ultron Nodes section of UltronScan**](https://www.ultronscan.io/ultronnodes/).
2. Choose either an Ultron or Candidate node for delegating your stake, and click on **Delegate** on
   the line of the node you have chosen.

:::tip

Ultron nodes and candidate nodes both have opportunities to produce blocks on the network.  Choose either
an Ultron or candidate node that does not have a penalty score as nodes that have penalty scores >30 are not
eligible to product blocks on the network.  Read the
[**whitepaper**](https://ultronglow.cdn.prismic.io/ultronglow/d6314945-bd40-415f-897f-cd39b7522aa9_UltronGlow-Whitepaper.pdf)
for more details.

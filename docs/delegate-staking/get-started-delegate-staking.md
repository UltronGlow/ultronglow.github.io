## What is staking?
[**UltronGlow**](https://www.ultronglow.io) is an EVM-compatible Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network.
Validators on any PoS network perform the important task of ordering and appending transactions to
the ledger.  In UltronGlow, the PoS consensus mechanism has been improved to ensure any participant
that wants to validate on the network has a fair chance to do so.  

Validators are operated by individuals or companies that have sufficient compute, networking and power
infrastructure to ensure the validator node(s) they are operating are highly-available.  Operators of 
validators must stake an amount of UTG into the staking smart contract which acts as a bond.  In the
event that their validator is unavailable or malicious, this amount can be taken-away (slashed) from the
operator.  As an incentive for operating a reliable, honest validator, operators earn UTG through the
MPoS consensus.  The more UTG they stake, the more MPoS rewards they earn.

Staking helps secure the UltronGlow network by injecting liquidity into the network that is subject for
forfeiture in the event that validators are maliciously.  The more UTG staked in the network, the higher
the incentive for honest operation.  To see the total amount of UTG staked in validators on the network,
see the [**UltronNodes page UltronScan**](https://www.ultronscan.io/ultronnodes/).

## What is delegate staking?
Since operating a validator node requires specific computing hardware and a highly-available infrastructure,
many people are not equipped to do so and earn MPoS rewards.  Delegate staking is the ability for anyone
with UTG tokens to "delegate" some of their tokens into an existing validator on the network and share in
the MPoS rewards.  The more UTG staked into a validator node gives more opportunity for being chosen as an
active validator on the network (Ultron node) and earning more rewards.

For details on how delegate staking works and potential for earning, see the
[**UltronGlow Whitepaper**](https://ultronglow.cdn.prismic.io/ultronglow/d6314945-bd40-415f-897f-cd39b7522aa9_UltronGlow-Whitepaper.pdf).


## Prerequisites
In order to delegate stake UTG tokens on the UltronGlow network, you need to do the following:

* [**Install Metamask**](https://metamask.io/download/) and create a new account if you haven't
  already.
* Purchase a minimum of 20 UTG (UltronGlow's native token) from
  [**Hotcoin Global**](https://www.hotcoin.com/) or [**Bitmart**](https://www.bitmart.com/) and transfer your UTG
  to your MetaMask wallet.

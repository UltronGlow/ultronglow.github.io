[UltronGlow](https://www.ultronglow.io) is a decentralized storage network designed to store,
back-up and share your data, securely and privately.  Additionally, you can offer your surplus
storage capacity on your computer to other members of the network while earning rewards (UTG)
for doing so. 

There are 3 ways to participate in the UltronGlow ecosystem:

* Become a Validator on UltronGlow's Proof-of-Stake network
* Share your surplus storage on the UltronGlow network and earn rewards
* Rent storage from others on the UltronGlow network

## Become a Validator on UltronGlow
If you are familiar with mining on other networks, such as Ethereum, then becoming an **UltronGlow Validator**
will likely be a similar experience.  However, if you have not previously set up a Validator
on other Proof-of-Stake networks, beware that it can be a complicated process.

To become a Validator on the UltronGlow network, head over to 
[Become a Validator](become-a-validator/get-started-validator.md) to get started!

## Sharing storage on UltronGlow
Sharing your computer's surplus storage on the UltronGlow network makes your
computer a **Storage Provider**, and mining node on the network. By providing storage on the UltronGlow
network, you not only help decentralize the world's data, you earn rewards that you can use for applications
on the network - such as renting other's storage to take a defense-in-depth approach to backing-up your data.

To become an UltronGlow Storage Provider, head over to
[Become a Storage Provider](become-a-storage-provider/get-started-storage-provider.md)
to get started!

## Rent storage from other Storage Providers on UltronGlow
If you don't have surplus storage to share on the UltronGlow network, or setting-up a Validator is a bit too
daunting, don't worry.  You can still participate in UltronGlow by renting storage from other Storage Providers on
the network.  

To rent storage, head over to [Rent Storage Space](rent-storage-space/get-started-renting.md) to get started!
